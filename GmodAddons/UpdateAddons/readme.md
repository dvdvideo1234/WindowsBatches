### Description
This is designed to scout through your [Garry's mod][ref-gam-gm] addons folder and update every
git repository there. It is detected using the existing configuration
`.git` folder that contains repo information

### Install
This does not need to get installed. [Works, therefore it exists][ref-dec-ph].

### How to use
[Drag and drop][ref-drg-dr] a cloned GitHub addon folder onto the [`UpdateAddons.bat`][ref-bat-sp] [batch][ref-use-bs] icon

### Why use it
I am an automation engineer and I prefer to automate everything to have more
personal time for myself. I am a person who values his time very much, so that
I attempt to apply this to my daily life.
